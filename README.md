# DNN_Maze_Solver
Deep neural network trained by inverse Djikstra algorithm to function as a heuristic for A* search of close to optimal paths for mazes. The notebook contains comparisons of the Neural Network and the Euclidian heuristic solving mazes (generated images) and final results.
For more details see the presentation.
